# Bikesharing

For the first Deliverable, I converted the tripduration columan from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds format, using Python and Pandas.  Next, to complete this deliverable, I exported the citibike database as a CSV file to use for the second deliverable where we perform the trip analysis. 

The second deliverable required us to create visualizations for the trip analysis.  I created visualizations using Tableu that show, how long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, how many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders, and a breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

There are two visualizations I would like to see added for a future analysis.  A visualization about revenue per hour by gender and weekday would help deciding to offer specials or buddy rates to increase usage during the weekday and weekends, as well as further engage the female demograph.  Another helpful visualization would be one that looks at businesses along our routes to see if we can partner with them for ride shares to work or even team building events that could be used to convert their workers a s subscribers on a discounted rate.  A visualizations that shows conversion rate of non-subscribers to subscribers for females
